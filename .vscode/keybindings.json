// This file is practically useless. It doesn't really affect VSCode what-so-ever.
// BUT! I kept it because it contains my most wanted/preferred keybindings,
// which you can then copy and paste inside a file called keybindings.json, which
// DOES affect VSCode. To get to it, hit cmd+shift+p, and type:
// "Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)"
// Copy-Paste the contents of this file there, and replace whatever is in there.
